## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You need to have the following software installed on your machine:

  - [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) (version 1.21 or later)
  - [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
  - [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/go-ecommerce-api.git
    cd go-ecommerce-api
    ```

2.  **Create an environment file:**
    Copy the example environment file and update it with your configuration.

    ```sh
    cp .env.example .env

3.  **Run the application with Docker Compose:**
    This is the recommended way to run the project locally. It will start the Go API server and a PostgreSQL database container.

    ```sh
    docker-compose up --build
    ```

The API server will be running on `http://localhost:8080`.
